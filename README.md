# search-engine
**ABOUT**

This is a search engine program, implemented in Python. It indexes the tokens in a local collection of documents and generates files necessary for query result retrieval. It performs retreival through a local web app.

**REQUIREMENTS**

The program assumes that the files are set up in this way:
* DEV
  * the corpus
* search-engine
  * all the files in the README's parent folder
* index
  * all the files that will be generated by running the code

**DEPENDENCIES**

The following libraries are necessary for this program to run:
* [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
* [Flask WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Simhash](https://leons.im/posts/a-python-implementation-of-simhash-algorithm/)

**HOW TO USE IT**

Assuming the files have not been built, this is how you generate and run them. Note that scanner.py, merger.py, and filebuilder.py may take a while to run.
1. Make sure the folders are set up as described above
1. Run scanner.py. This will generate a set of partial indices named 0.txt, 1.txt, etc. It will also create a file mapping docID to URL.
1. Run merger.py. This will consolidate the partial indices into one index, named not_main.txt.
1. Run filebuilder.py. This will create the final index, named main.txt, which includes the computed tf-idf scores for each word's postings, sorted by score.
1. In order to launch the web GUI for retrieval, run interface2.py and open the URL printed in console in a web browser.
