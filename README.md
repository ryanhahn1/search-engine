# search-engine
**ABOUT**

This is a search engine program, implemented in Python. It indexes the tokens in a local collection of documents and generates files necessary for query result retrieval. It performs retreival through a local web app.

**FEATURES**
1. Indexing by batch, enables indexing a corpus of any size.
1. Near-duplicate detection
1. Scoring anchor text for target pages
1. PageRank
1. Web GUI

**DEPENDENCIES**

The following libraries are necessary for this program to run:
* [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
* [Flask WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Simhash](https://leons.im/posts/a-python-implementation-of-simhash-algorithm/)

**REQUIREMENTS**

The program assumes that the files are set up in this way:
* DEV
  * the corpus documents
* search-engine
  * all the files in the README's parent folder
* index
  * all the files that will be generated by running the code


**HOW TO USE IT**

Assuming the files have not been built, this is how you generate and run them. Note that scanner.py, merger.py, and filebuilder.py may take a while to run.
1. Make sure the folders are set up as described above
1. Run scanner.py. This will generate a set of partial indices named 0.txt, 1.txt, etc. It will also create a file mapping docID to URL.
1. Run merger.py. This will consolidate the partial indices into one index, named not_main.txt.
1. Run filebuilder.py. This will create the final index, named main.txt, which includes the computed tf-idf scores for each word's postings, sorted by score.
1. Run ranking.py. This will create the files necessary for PageRank and anchor text scoring.
1. In order to launch the web GUI for retrieval, run interface2.py and open the URL printed in console in a web browser.
